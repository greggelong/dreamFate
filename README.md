working on somebody's dream,

Long answer. Yes but it is about the encoding, 
 The branches are a type of binary or fractal tree, in math called a Pythagorean tree. Most people create them with recursion, but they can be created by counting in binary and moving the branches left or right for “0” and “1”.   In this way a branch is an encoding of a certain number.  A few years ago I had created a very clunky visualization using these branches encoded with a number to encode a letter is ascii, in the video it is “reading” Alice in wonderland
So in this encoding “yes” and “no” would be would be groups of three and two tentacles. 
The description of your dream, my recent work with encoding messages and moving popsicle sticks with servo’s, was the cause for me to re-visit this Pythagorean tree.
Visual encoding: I think there is an interesting way to bring re-create the ‘Yes’ and ‘no’ branches from your dream.  a branch is made up of branch segments and some segments are joined to other and each has an angle it should ultimately move to.  These segments and angles are held in the “dna” of the branch. The code is slightly more complicated. But I have been interested in genetic algorithms recently and this is a good case for it.
